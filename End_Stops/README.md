# End Stops

**Author:**  	Dominic Forbush

**Version:** 	WEC-Sim v4.1

**Geometry**	RM3

Example on using [End-Stops] (http://wec-sim.github.io/WEC-Sim/man/advanced_features.html#constraint-and-pto-features) to run WEC-Sim for the RM3 geometry. Execute WEC-Sim in either the v2019a or legacy sub-directory script to run this case.  
The implementation in v2019a will function on MATLAB 2019a and newer versions. It will not cause an error in older MATLAB versions, but it will not actually implement end-stops. 
On older MATLAB versions, please use the alternative workflow suggested in the legacy sub-directory.
