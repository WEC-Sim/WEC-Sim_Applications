# Body-to-Body Interactions

**Author:** Kelley Ruehl

**Version:** WEC-Sim v2.2

**Geometry:** RM3

Example using [Body-to-Body (B2B)](http://wec-sim.github.io/WEC-Sim/advanced_features.html#body-to-body-interactions) to run WEC-Sim for the [RM3](http://wec-sim.github.io/WEC-Sim/tutorials.html#two-body-point-absorber-rm3) geometry. The scripts run and plot the RM3 model with B2B on/off and with Regular/RegularCIC. Execute the `runB2B.m` script to run this case.
