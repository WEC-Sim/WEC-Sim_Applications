# Oscillating Water Column

**Authors:** Mohamed Shabara, Jeff Grasberger and Jorge Leon-Quiroga

**Version:** WEC-Sim v6.1.x

**Geometry:** Floating OWC Rigid Body Approach

This model simulates a Floating Oscillating Water Column (OWC) device using a rigid-body approach. 
It incorporates performance curves for both a Wells Turbine and a generator, providing a realistic 
representation of their dynamic behavior. Additionally, the model accounts for the presence of a
 mooring system to ensure the stability of the floating body.

An optimal control strategy is implemented to maximize turbine efficiency by dynamically adjusting system parameters based on operating speed.

This model is based on the research detailed in:
Shabara, Mohamed A., et al. "Optimal Control of Floating Oscillating Water Column Wave Energy Converters." 2025 American Control Conference (ACC), IEEE, 2025.
