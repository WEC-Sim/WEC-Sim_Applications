**Version:** 	WEC-Sim v4.4

**Geometry:**	Floating hemisphere with 1 m radius

One example using the mean drift function provided by WEC-Sim. Details on the mean drift implement can be found on the WEC-Sim documentation [webpage](http://wec-sim.github.io/WEC-Sim/dev/theory/theory.html#sinusoidal-steady-state-response). In this WEC-Sim applications case there are two folders: 1) WAMIT and 2) WECSim. The WAMIT folder contains an example set of the required input files that allow WAMIT to calculate the mean drift forces with the corresponding output files. The WECSim folder includes a working WECSim model of a heaving hemisphere that includes mean drift forcing.
