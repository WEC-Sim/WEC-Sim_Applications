**WEC-Sim Model**
Numerical model for a semi-submerged sphere (diameter = 10 m) with a latching controller. "wecSim" can be typed into 
the command window to run the example with the default setup. "optimalTimeCalc.m" is used to calculate the 
optimal latching time. The "mcrBuildTimes.m" script can be run to set up multiple conditions runs, then 
"wecSimMCR" can be typed into the command window to run the different cases with varying latching times.
