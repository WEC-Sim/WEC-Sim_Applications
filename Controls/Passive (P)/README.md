# WEC-Sim Controls Examples

**WEC-Sim Version:** v5.0 (or newer)

**Matlab Version:** 2020b (or newer)

**WEC-Sim Model**
Numerical model for a semi-submerged sphere (diameter = 10 m) with a passive controller. 
"wecSim" can be typed into the command window to run the example with the default setup. "optimalGainCalc.m" 
is used to calculate the optimal proportional gain. The "mcrBuildGains.m" script can be run to set up 
multiple conditions runs, then "wecSimMCR" can be typed into the command window to run the different 
cases with varying proportional gain values.
