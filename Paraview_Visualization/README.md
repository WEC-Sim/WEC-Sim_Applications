# Paraview Visualization

**Author:**  	Carlos Michelen

**Version:** 	WEC-Sim v2.2 and Paraview 5.9.1

**Geometry**	OSWEC and RM3

Example using ParaView data visualization for WEC-Sim coupled with [MoorDyn](http://wec-sim.github.io/WEC-Sim/advanced_features.html#moordyn) to simulate a more realistic mooring system for the [RM3](http://wec-sim.github.io/WEC-Sim/tutorials.html#two-body-point-absorber-rm3) geometry. Example consists of 3 catenary mooring lines attached to different points on the spar and anchored at the sea floor.   


Example using ParaView data visualization for WEC-Sim with [Non-linear Hydro](http://wec-sim.github.io/WEC-Sim/advanced_features.html#nonlinear-buoyancy-and-froude-krylov-excitation) for the Flap and a [Non-Hydro Body](http://wec-sim.github.io/WEC-Sim/advanced_features.html#non-hydrodynamic-bodies) for the Base to run WEC-Sim for the [OSWEC](http://wec-sim.github.io/WEC-Sim/tutorials.html#oscillating-surge-wec-oswec) geometry.
