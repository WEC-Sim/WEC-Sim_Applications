# Paraview Visualization

**Author:**  	Carlos Michelen

**Version:** 	WEC-Sim v4.2 and Paraview 5.9.1

**Geometry**	OSWEC and RM3

The **RM3_MoorDyn_Viz** example uses ParaView for WEC-Sim data visualization of a WEC-Sim model coupled with [MoorDyn](http://wec-sim.github.io/WEC-Sim/advanced_features.html#moordyn) to simulate a mooring system for the [RM3](http://wec-sim.github.io/WEC-Sim/tutorials.html#two-body-point-absorber-rm3) geometry. This WEC-Sim example consists of 3 catenary mooring lines attached to different points on the spar, and anchored at the sea floor.   


The **OSWEC_NonLinear_Viz** example uses ParaView for WEC-Sim data visualization of a WEC-Sim model with [Non-linear Hydro](http://wec-sim.github.io/WEC-Sim/advanced_features.html#nonlinear-buoyancy-and-froude-krylov-excitation) to simulate non-linear wave excitation on the flap of the [OSWEC](http://wec-sim.github.io/WEC-Sim/tutorials.html#oscillating-surge-wec-oswec) geometry. 
This WEC-Sim example uses [Non-linear Hydro](http://wec-sim.github.io/WEC-Sim/advanced_features.html#nonlinear-buoyancy-and-froude-krylov-excitation) to model wave loading on the flap, and [Non-Hydro Body](http://wec-sim.github.io/WEC-Sim/advanced_features.html#non-hydrodynamic-bodies) to model the base of the [OSWEC](http://wec-sim.github.io/WEC-Sim/tutorials.html#oscillating-surge-wec-oswec) geometry.
