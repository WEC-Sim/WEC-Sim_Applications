**Author:**  	Carlos Michelen

**Version:** 	WEC-Sim v2.0

**Note:**	This is not a WEC-Sim example.

This is an example of how to write your own h5 file using MATLAB. 
Can be useful if you want to modify your coefficients, use experimental coefficients, or coefficients from another BEM code other than NEMOH, WAMIT, or AQWA.
